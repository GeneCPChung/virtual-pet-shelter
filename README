Virtual Pet Shelter
- Created README

//Done
Virtual Pet Class

In addition to the requirements from last week's project:

- include instance variables representing:
  - name
  - description
- include a constructor that accepts a name and description only
- include a constructor that, in addition to name and description, accepts starting values for the pet's attributes (hunger, boredom, etc)
- Do not include a default (zero arguments) constructor. You will find that it is OK to have more than one constructor. This will be called an overloaded constructor
